EveWebTrading
=============

Initially designed to create an exchange on which trading stocks is possible using a continuous double auction.

This can be used for simulating a trading competition.

It uses python's tornado framework, along with websockets to push data to the endpoint in real time.

Will Include:

real time stock data (based on fake stocks traded on the exchange)
News data (modeled after news events that occur around real stocks)
